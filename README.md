# Employee Tracker
  

  ## Description
  
  This command-line application is a simple content management system that allows users to view and update an employee database. The program has seven commands, three of which allow the user to view each table in the database (employees, roles, and departments), three of which add data to a specific table in the database, and one command to update an employee's role. This application's main purpose is to allow non-developers to access and manage company data.

  ## Installation
  
  To install the necessary packages for this application, the user can simply type "npm i" into terminal. In order for the packages to install correctly, the user must be inside the program folder when the install command is run.
  
  ## Usage
  
  To run this application, the user can input "node index". Once node index is inputted, the ASCII logo renders and a small menu appears below it. To navigate the menu, simply use the up and down arrow keys. To select an option, press 'Enter'. The commands that add and update data all prompt the user with a series of follow-up questions to collect the new data to be inputted. Like the main menu, the user can navigate list prompts with pre-set choices by using the up and down arrow keys. 

  NOTE: The requirements of this assignment stated that when an employee is added, the user would be asked to input the employee's manager. I decided that I wanted to make a more intuitive application, so I designed the "Add Employee" and "Update Employee Role" functions so that a manager is automatically selected for a new employee based on their role.
